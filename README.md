# Hydra Power Steering

Once a year, the Hydra Steering Group convened a meeting dedicated to strategic planning. For the benefits of perspective and additional expertise, community members from across the HydraSphere are invited to participate. To keep the meetings effective and at a manageable size, and to ensure a representative cross-section of the community, the list of those invited to participate each year is created with an eye to diversity and expertise in the key issues and opportunities on the agenda.

This project is designed to keep track of issues and progress for Power Steering throughout the year, note responsible parties, and to retain knowledge from year to year.

In spring 2017, Hydra Partners met as a group rather than a separate power steering group.
